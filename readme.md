# Bitcoin Test
Just some simple python and bitcoin exercises at the moment

## Software Functionality in get_blocks_info folder
  * retrive data of block from a specific day (timestamp) end filter by number (return only a set of)
  * calculate the total satoshi value on every block
  * save the block data to a json file
  * visualize the json file with html, css and js (not completed: the json is not loaded dinamically, at the time of writing is copied and pasted manually). 
  
How to start this program?
Just open the html file in a browser to visualize it or launch the main.py with 'python3 main.py'

Todo:
  - better error handling. Add some test on function.
